# Merkle-tree

Merkle tree also known as hash tree is a data structure used for data verification and synchronization. 
It is a tree data structure where each non-leaf node is a hash of itâ€™s child nodes. All the leaf nodes are at the same depth and are as far left as possible. 
It maintains data integrity and uses hash functions for this purpose.
Merkle trees are useful in distributed systems where same data should exist in multiple places.
Merkle trees can be used to check inconsistencies.
Apache Cassandra uses Merkle trees to detect inconsistencies between replicas of entire databases.
It is used in bitcoin and blockchain.
Merkle trees are made by hashing pairs of nodes repeatedly until only one hash remains; this hash is known as the Merkle Root or the Root Hash.
They're built from the bottom, using Transaction IDs, which are hashes of individual transactions. 
Each non-leaf node is a hash of its previous hash, and every leaf node is a hash of transactional data.
